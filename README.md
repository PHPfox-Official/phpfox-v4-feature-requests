# PHPfox Feature Request

Use this [feature tracker](https://github.com/moxi9/phpfox-feature-requests/issues) to post any features you want to see in phpFox.

Please keep larger requests here in the community forum area for third party developers to consider making apps and for us to also see in the future should some good requests come in here that third party developers don't make.

This official feature request area is for improvements needed such as adding a button for internal message submit, etc.

Please search the feature request tracker to ensure you don't post duplicates.

Please be sure to comment in the features here that you want to see improved as it helps us to know what clients really want. Note that we will not judge things as we did before, based on votes as that caused some bad feature implementations. However, it does help us to see which things are more popular for the requests that we accept.

When submitting a feature improvement, please post the following in order for us to consider it and for it not to be rejected for lack of information:

*Do:*

1. Include in the title the name of the feature you want improved and a short description (Example: Video - improve url).
2. Include in the main text of the issue exactly what one thing needs to improve. ONE thing. Be very descriptive.
3. If possible, include a screen shot
4. Only put one feature improvement per issue.


*Don't:*

1. Say "just like this" site (facebook, etc) as we won't know what you want, don't want to have to go visit a place and sign up to see the features and this description is far too vague
2. Say a one word thing for what you want (I want a link). That's far too vague.
3. Don't put more than one feature improvement per issue. We will reject any feature improvements with more than one thing as we can only work on one thing per revision number.

Example of a good one:
Title: PM message submit button
Description: In the PM message system, if we hit Enter, it sends the message. Please make a send or submit button so that hitting Enter does not send the message but it requires us to hit the Send or submit button to send it.
(screen shot would be here)

Example of a bad one:
Title: Fix this like facebook
Description: I want the feed to be like facebook. Change the photos to look like popular sites. Move the profile over a little. Take the language and put it at top. Make me sign in with my language already done.
Thanks!
